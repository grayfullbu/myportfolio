                <p  style="margin-left:-1em; padding-bottom: 0;">In my IT course,  required to analyze and 
                    evaluate information, draw logical conclusions, and make connections between different IT concepts or theories. 
                    This could involve tasks such as debugging code, troubleshooting network issues, or identifying vulnerabilities 
                    in a system.</p>

        <div class="box">
            <h1 style="font-size: 30px;margin-left:-1.2em;">Creative Thinking</h1>
            <p  style="margin-left:-1em; padding-bottom: 0; width: 100%;">In IT, creative thinking often comes into play when you need to find innovative 
                solutions to problems or develop new approaches to design and development. It involves thinking outside the 
                box, exploring alternative strategies, and being open to unconventional ideas or technologies.</p>

        <div class="box">
            <h1 style="font-size: 30px;margin-left:-1.2em;">Decision Making</h1>
            <p  style="margin-left:-1em; padding-bottom: 0;">IT courses often present scenarios where you have to make
                decisions based on available information and constraints. This could involve selecting appropriate technologies 
                for a project, deciding on the best software architecture, or choosing the most effective security measures for
                 a system.</p>

        <div class="box">
            <h1 style="font-size: 30px;  width: 100%; margin-left:-1.2em;">Problem Solving</h1>
            <p  style="margin-left:-1em; padding-bottom: 0; width: 100%;">Problem-solving is a fundamental skill in IT.
                my course is likely to provide opportunities to solve technical challenges, debug code, 
                resolve system malfunctions, or develop solutions to meet specific requirements. Demonstrating 
                effective problem-solving skills involves identifying the problem, breaking it down, formulating 
                strategies, and implementing solutions.</p>
                <p  style="margin-left:-1em; padding-bottom: 0; width: 100%;"> To relate these competencies to my personal experience, reflect on my coursework, projects, 
                internships, or any practical experience you have gained during my IT course. Consider how you have 
                applied learning, reasoning, creative thinking, decision making, and problem-solving skills in various 
                IT-related contexts and highlight specific examples to demonstrate my proficiency in these areas.</p>

    <h1 style="font-size:50px; padding: 10px; color:yellow; text-align: center;margin-left:7em;margin-top: 90px;"> WORK EXPERIENCE</h1>
    <p style="margin-left:3em; padding-bottom: 0;text-align: center;line-height: 2; color: aliceblue;"> During my OJT (On-the-Job Training) experience as a front-end developer at NEDA XI, I gained valuable insights and hands-on experience in web development. I collaborated with the development team, actively participating in the creation and enhancement of user-facing components for websites and applications. Using my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I translated design concepts into functional and visually appealing interfaces.

    Throughout my tenure, I worked closely with designers and stakeholders to understand project requirements and deliver optimal user experiences. I implemented responsive layouts, optimized page performance, and ensured cross-browser compatibility. Additionally, I incorporated interactive elements using JavaScript to enhance user engagement and functionality.
    
    During the OJT, I had the opportunity to contribute to real-world projects, sharpening my problem-solving skills and attention to detail. I actively participated in code reviews, learned to adhere to coding standards, and gained experience in version control systems.
    
    Working in the dynamic environment of NEDA XI exposed me to various challenges and allowed me to develop effective communication and collaboration skills. I learned to effectively manage deadlines and adapt to changing project requirements, all while maintaining a high level of professionalism and attention to quality.
    
    Overall, my work experience as an OJT student at NEDA XI as a front-end developer provided me with practical knowledge, enhanced my technical abilities, and strengthened my understanding of web development principles. It was a valuable opportunity to apply my skills in a real-world setting, paving the way for a successful career in the field of front-end development.</p>
